# **StethAim - Audio Waveform Generator**

[![GitHub Repository](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Repository-blue)](https://github.com/Sonalilipsa17375/Stethaim-audiowavegenerate)

## **Overview**
**StethAim** is an innovative mobile application that generates **audio waveforms** for lung sound recordings, enabling **remote monitoring** of respiratory health. Built with **React Native (Expo Go)** and **Peaks.js**, this app processes audio files captured by a **digital stethoscope** and provides detailed waveform visualizations, aiding healthcare professionals in diagnosing respiratory conditions.

---

## **Features**
- üìÅ **Audio File Upload:** Upload lung sound recordings in `.wav` or `.mp3` formats.
- üìä **Interactive Waveform Visualization:** Displays precise audio waveforms using **Peaks.js**.
- üåê **Remote Monitoring:** Supports healthcare professionals with visual insights into lung sound patterns.
- üì± **Android Compatibility:** Optimized for Android devices using **React Native with Expo Go**.
- üé® **User-Friendly Design:** Intuitive UI for seamless interaction.

---

## **Technology Stack**
- **React Native with Expo Go**: Cross-platform app development framework.
- **Peaks.js**: Library for rendering and interacting with audio waveforms.
- **Digital Stethoscope Integration**: High-quality audio capture for medical analysis.

---

## **How to Use**
1. Open the app on your Android device.
2. Upload an audio file of lung sounds captured via a digital stethoscope.
3. View the **waveform visualization** generated by the app.
4. Share or analyze the waveform for diagnostic purposes.
